## Next.js Authentication Sample with NextAuth and MongoDB

Welcome to the Next.js Authentication Sample repository! This project demonstrates a basic authentication flow using NextAuth in a Next.js application, with MongoDB as the database and Mongoose as the ODM (Object Data Modeling) library. The sample includes functionalities for user registration, login, and logout, showcasing a straightforward approach to handling user authentication in modern web applications.

### Features

- **User Registration**: Allows new users to create an account by providing their credentials.
- **User Login**: Enables existing users to log in using their registered email and password.
- **User Logout**: Provides a secure way for users to log out of their session.
- **Session Management**: Utilizes NextAuth to manage user sessions, ensuring secure and seamless authentication.
- **MongoDB Integration**: Leverages MongoDB for persistent storage of user data, connected via Mongoose for schema definition and data modeling.

### Technologies Used

- **Next.js**: A powerful React framework for building server-side rendered and statically generated web applications.
- **NextAuth**: An easy-to-implement authentication solution for Next.js applications.
- **MongoDB**: A scalable, NoSQL database used for storing user information.
- **Mongoose**: An elegant MongoDB object modeling tool for Node.js.
